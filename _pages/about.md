Hi, I'm Sunyu Wang, a fourth-year PhD student in Urban Data Science at the [Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong](https://www.arch.hku.hk/departments-and-divisions/department-of-urban-planning-and-design/), supervised by [Professor Anthony Gar-On Yeh](https://www.arch.hku.hk/staff/upad/yeh-anthony-g-o/?dept=upad). Before joining HKU, I got my master's degree in Spatial Data Science and Visualization from the [Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa).

Please feel free to get in touch!
