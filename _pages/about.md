Hi, I'm Sunyu Wang, a fourth-year PhD student in Urban Data Science at the Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Professor Anthony Gar-On Yeh. Before joining HKU, I got my master's degree in Spatial Data Science and Visualization from the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London, and my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Xiamen University.
